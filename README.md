# Owner Sync Safe

UUPS upgradeable system for synchronizing Safe owners across multiple chains and Safes.

## Overview

Owner Sync Safe provides a secure, upgradeable infrastructure for managing Safe owners across multiple chains. The system uses the UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) pattern to enable future upgrades while maintaining state consistency.

## Key Features

- **UUPS Upgradeable**: Both manager and modules support secure upgrades
- **Cross-Safe Operations**: Synchronize owners across multiple Safes
- **Two-Step Ownership**: Enhanced security with `Ownable2Step` pattern
- **Storage Gaps**: Future-proof storage layout for upgrades
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage for UUPS functionality

## Architecture

The system consists of two main components:

1. **SafeModuleManager**: UUPS proxy that creates and manages all modules
2. **ManagedSafeModule**: Individual UUPS modules for each Safe

For detailed architecture information, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).
